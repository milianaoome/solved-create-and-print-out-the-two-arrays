Part I: Create and print out the two arrays: (Be sure to do this first) You are allowed to hard code these arrays into your program. You can also put the data into a file and read the information into the program. The data is as follows: Anne 150 Bob 250 Ralph 305 Tim 250 Barbara 85 Jane 160 Steve 180 Tom 210 Mike 165 Shirley 155 Pam 125 Frank 130



Part II: The elevators in our building have an 1100 lb. load limit. Determine which people in the list above get on the elevator. Print their names, weights, total weight, and how many got on. Part III: Rearrange these people in asscending sequence by weight and print the two arrays. Determine again how many may ride the elevator, printing out their names, weights, total weight and the number of how many people got on.

Part IV: Rearrange these people in descending sequence by name (USE A DIFFERENT SORT ALGORITHM THAN THE ONE YOU USED IN PART III) and print the two arrays. Determine again how many may ride the elevator, printing out their names, weights, total weight and the number of how many people got on.

Part V: Have the program determine which method allowed the most people to get on the elevator. The program should compare the three different counts of how many people got on the elevator in each of the scenarios above â€“ with the weight array as given, with the weight array in ascenging order, with the name array in descending order.

This program should include: 2 different sort functions a function to determine how many people get on the elevator (will be called 3 times) a print function which prints both arrays (include a size parameter and it can be called 6 times).Make sure all methods are writen to handle n elements, not just 12. You can pass 12 from main to n in the method/function. Turn in: The assignment sheet, algorithm for main, source code, output and Academic Honesty Promise.

EXTRA CREDIT: Read the data from a file and put the results on an output file. Print the output file using Notepad or some other editor.
